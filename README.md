* Unique dual-row key layout allows for fast swype-like control.
* Choose auto-send for maximum speed, or manual-send to make composing chords easier.
* preview panel allows ambiguous or multi-stroke words to be chosen from a list.  Unknown strokes can be learned by long-pressing on a word in the list.
